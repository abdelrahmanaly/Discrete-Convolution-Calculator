# Discrete-Convolution-Calculator

This Project is inspired by Digital Signal Processing and The fundemental concept of filtering in Electrical engieering. It is a Visual Representation of Convolution done using Python in the Discrete Domain. This is a great tool to help you visualize more how filter works, and if you have any questions please feel free to add comments and i can make more functions for this program.

## Getting Started
In order to get this Project you will need to clone this repo on your computer using the GUI of github.

### Pre-requisites
You will need to have a couple of things installed before we can get started.
This project uses external libraries which you can install through pip3, This Code is written in Python3 and will not complie in a Python 2 interperter.

```
You will need to install Numpy library, this library is like a package of wonderful and handy calculator tools that we need to use in order to do the discrete calculation of convolution.

You will also need to install Matplotlib, this library is like a package to Help you plot easier using built in GUI functions that some smart person already figured out.
```

### Installing

To install Numpy, open up termminal and write the following:
```
pip3 install numpy 
```
if it doesn't work try using Sudo before the command:
```
sudo pip3 install numpy
``` 

To install Matplotlib, write in terminal the following command:
```
pip3 install matplotlib 
```
if it doesn't work try using Sudo before the command:
```
sudo pip3 install matplotlib
```
### Built for
This project was done and built for any struglling electrical students, I did this as a learning project, and i will try to keep updating it by adding more functions, feel free to fork it and work on it as well.
